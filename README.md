# EE8603 Final Project - Abalone Regression
## Created by: Brendan Wood - November 29, 2023
This repository is Brendan Wood's final project submission for EE 8603.

## About the Project
The code in this repository uses PyCaret to perform a linear regression on the [Abalone dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/1/abalone). The program then saves the best performing model and illustrates some parameters and metrics of the model.

## Running Instructions
The preferred method for running this notebook is in Google Collab. All cells should be excecuted in order.
